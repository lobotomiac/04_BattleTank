#### 04_BattleTank - A Fun Tank Battle with Mortars
Part of [The Unreal Engine Developer Course by Ben Tristem](https://www.udemy.com/unrealcourse/learn/v4/overview), with a few deviations for deeper learning.

A BattleTank game made from scratch for two player to battle to death by trying to hit each other with explosive shells. Both player can be human, or a player can battle an AI enemy and try to win. It is a first game as in it is a learning experience but at the same time aimed to be fun and engaging.
